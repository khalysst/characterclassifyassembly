# Character Classification in Assembly

<p> In this program, the user will be required to enter any character from the keyboard. 
Once any key is pressed, the system will automatically process the input and classify it whether it is 
an ALPHABET (lowercase / uppercase), a NUMBER (prime / non-prime) and a SPECIAL CHARACTER. </p>

</br>

<b> Please note that this requires an appropriate platform to run. (DOSBox, TASM) </b> </br>
This is a laboratory activity from my university which has time constraints. 
So do forgive any code inconsistencies.
